# Olympics EDA Project  

## Overview  
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the official Olympics dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset contains detailed information about athletes, teams, coaches, medal counts, and gender participation across multiple Olympic Games. The goal is to clean, analyze and visualize the data to uncover interesting patterns, trends and insights about Olympic history and participation.  

## Files in the Repository  
- **Athletes.xlsx** â€“ Detailed information about all athletes who participated in the Olympics.  
- **Coaches.xlsx** â€“ Dataset containing information about coaches by sport and country.  
- **EntriesGender.xlsx** â€“ Gender-based participation data for each sport and country.  
- **Medals.xlsx** â€“ Medal counts and distribution across countries and disciplines.  
- **Teams.xlsx** â€“ Data about teams and their participation in different events.  
- **Olympics_EDA.ipynb** â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing all code, visualizations, and analysis.  
- **README.md** â€“ Project documentation and details.  

## Objectives  
- Load and inspect all datasets to understand their structure and relationships.  
- Perform data cleaning where necessary to handle missing or inconsistent values.  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify trends, patterns, and outliers.  
- Visualize findings with relevant charts and graphs for better understanding.  
- Derive insights about country performance, gender participation trends, and dominance in specific sports.  

## Tools & Libraries  
This project uses Python and popular data analysis/visualization libraries:  
- **pandas** for data manipulation  
- **numpy** for numerical operations  
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn** for visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis documentation  

## Future Work  
- Perform deeper statistical analysis and build comparative studies between countries and sports.  
- Create dashboards for interactive visualization.  
- Publish final insights and results as a structured report.
